The agenda of this website is to make it easier for people to find directions. It also gives satellite images. It helps you prepare for long drives and estimate costs by showing cost of fuel.
<br>
This website speaks to me as it is easy to navigate and visually easy to understand. Apart from directions it also gives the fuel cost which I think is quite important when planning longer drives.
<br>
This mapping works as it is easily navigable and can also be seen as satellite image. It also shows traffic updates such as any accidents and delays as well as the traffic signals itself. This gives you time to prepare for the drive.
I think this website does what it's supposed to do as it is very easy to work with and can also be sent to friends. 
<br>
This mapping website uses its own cartography data obtained from digital mapping companies and government databases.
<br>
Right now MapQuest has only driving and walking directions. While those are the most popular I think it would be beneficial to add public transport and biking directions.
